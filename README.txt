- Overview -
============
This is a simple calculator built using python with 
Tkinter GUI framework. The tkinter framework was used
to implement the application's interface from the window
to the control buttons. It is able to perform basic math
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division of both real numbers and decimals, as well as
computing for the square root of a number. It also contains
some scientific functions such as various trigonometric
and logarithmic functions.

- Instructions for Use -
========================
The following information details the application controls
and their respective functions.
* Display - appears at the top part of the window. Shows
the numerical inputs and results.
* Clear - labeled 'C'. Clears the current input.
* All Clear - labeled 'CE'. Clears everything, including
previous result.
* Square root - gets the square root of the input number.
* Numpad - numbered 0 - 9. Allows the user to make inputs
to the calculator.
* Operational buttons - sets whether the inputs will be added,
subtracted, multiplied, or divided.
* Period button - inserts a decimal period.
* Plus-or-minus - transforms the input into either positive or
negative value.
* Equal button = gets the result of the operation on the inputs.

There are also additional controls that can be accessed when in
Scientific mode:
* Pi - inputs the value of Pi
* 2Pi - inputs twice the value of Pi.
* cos, tan, and sin buttons - returns the cosine, tangent, and sine
values of the current input.
* cosh, tanh, and sinh buttons - returns the hyperbolic cosine, hyperbolic
tangent, and hyperbolic sine values of the current input.
* log - returns the logarithm of the current input
* log1p - returns the logarithm of the current input + 1
* log10, log2 -  returns the logarithm of the current input in base 10
and base 2 respectively.
* exp - returns the mathematical value of 'e' raised to the current input.
* expm1 - returns the value of exp()-1
* Mod - returns the remainder of two numbers.
* e - inputs the value of the mathematical number 'e'.
* gamma - used to calculate gamma functions
* deg - used to compute angles in degrees.
* acosh, asinh - returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine and inverse hyperbolic
sine of the input respectively.

Menubar - The calculator also contains the File menu which allows the user to
switch between standard and scientific mode, as well as to close the application.

To use the calculator, the user may follow these steps:
1) Input the numbers using the numpad, pi, 2pi, or e buttons
2) Select the operation to be performed on the numbers.
3) If the operation selected is either addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, or modulus, a second input is required; otherwise the result will be
displayed immediately.
4) If a second input is made, press the equal button to display the results.
